    <p>For those unfamiliar with Tailwind CSS, it is a highly customisable low-level CSS framework with helper classes
      for almost every CSS rule.
      Basically, an Angular project is composed of a set of modules containing components. Each component has a
      TypeScript file (.ts), an HTML file (.html) and a CSS, SCSS or SASS file (.css, .scss, .sass) depending on the
      design choice. With Tailwind, you can save a lot of effort by not having to create your own CSS classes as they
      are already present in most cases directly in Tailwind.

  <div class="mt-6 mx-auto">
    <tw-alert [type]="'info'" [appearance]="'border'">
      <span twAlertTitle>Info alert</span>
      For those wondering about the final size of the CSS file after the project
      has been compiled, don't worry ðŸ˜Š<br>
      You can set up a purge system with Tailwind to remove all CSS classes that are not used in the project
      during the build which will greatly reduce the final size of the CSS file.
