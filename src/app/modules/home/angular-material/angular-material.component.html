    <p>Angular Material is a library of UI components based on Material Design that developers can use in their
      projects.
      Angular Material offers reusable and already tested components (buttons, cards, dropdowns and many more...) which
      is a great time saver when designing a user interface. (Pretty cool isn't it? ðŸ˜Š)

    <p>The final work is to merge the functionality of Tailwind with the functionality of Angular Material. If you are
      interested, you can find this in the shared/material and shared/tailwind folders.
      To summarize, the idea is to create a Material Angular theme using the CSS classes and colours of Tailwind.
